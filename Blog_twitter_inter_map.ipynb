        "Throughout this global pandemic, it has been hard to know which companies will do well and which companies will do poorly. However, with a sentiment map such as the one shown above, it is much easier to understand how sectors in general are doing. Whilst this is not a definitive indication of how well any company will do, it does provide very valuable information that can be used to make better financial decisions.\n",
